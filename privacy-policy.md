# Privacy Policy for ZenPocket

*Last Updated: September 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Colo, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the ZenPocket mobile application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following information locally on your device only:
- **Chat conversations** with the AI Zen Teacher
- **Reading progress** and bookmarks for texts
- **Meditation session** records (duration and completion)
- **App preferences** (analytics setting)

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly use the chat feature, which requires internet connectivity.

### Information Used for Service Operation

- **Device Identifier**: We use your device's vendor ID solely for rate limiting purposes (maximum 10 chat messages per day). This ID is sent to our server only when you use the chat feature.
- **Chat Messages**: When you send a message in the chat feature, your message is transmitted to our server and then to OpenAI to generate responses. We do not store your messages on our servers.

### Analytics (Optional)

If you enable anonymous analytics in Settings:
- We collect basic usage metrics such as app launches, feature usage, and session duration
- No personally identifiable information is collected
- You can disable analytics at any time in Settings

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:
- Provide the chat functionality through OpenAI's API
- Enforce rate limiting to ensure fair usage
- Improve the App through anonymous analytics (if enabled)
- Track your reading progress and meditation sessions locally

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We share data only with:
- **OpenAI**: Chat messages are sent to OpenAI's API to generate responses. OpenAI's use of this data is governed by their privacy policy.

We do NOT:
- Sell your personal information
- Share data with advertisers
- Store your chat history on our servers
- Access the data stored locally on your device

## Data Security

- All data stored locally on your device is protected by iOS's built-in encryption
- Communication with our servers uses HTTPS encryption
- We implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App
- **Server Data**: Device IDs used for rate limiting are retained for 24 hours only
- **Chat Messages**: Not stored on our servers; only transmitted to OpenAI

## Your Rights and Controls

You can:
- **Delete Chat History**: Clear individual room histories or all chats in Settings
- **Disable Analytics**: Toggle off anonymous analytics in Settings
